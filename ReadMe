# 📊 Turning Losses into Loyalty: Customer Churn Analysis

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn risk** in a **subscription-based fitness & wellness service** (yoga, gym, nutrition). The analysis converts raw customer data into **business insights** using **SQL for analysis** and **Microsoft Excel for dashboarding**.

The objective is to help management **reduce churn and increase customer loyalty** by understanding customer behavior patterns.

---

## 🧠 Business Case Context
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth. Management raised concerns such as:
- Why are customers leaving?
- Which subscription plans have higher churn?
- Can churn be predicted using engagement and feedback?

As a **Junior Data Analyst**, this project simulates a real-world business scenario where data-driven decisions are required.
